Folder for Coursera_Getting and Cleaning Data

This folder is creatd to upload files for Coursera Getting and Cleaning data course project.  
The project is to collect, cleaning and upload a cleaned dataset for later analysis. 
A R script file, the CodeBook for the project and the processed cleaned dataset are uploaded in this folder. 

To make the R script file work properly, you need download the raw data file into a directory and set it as working directory.  Make sure the data files are named 'DataSet'. 

Then you can use the R script file to clean the dataset and generated two cleaned datasets.  
One named: merged_data.txt, which contains data merged by the training and test datasets. 
The second named: data_with_means.txt, which is an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
